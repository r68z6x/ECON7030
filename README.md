Section   1:   Your   Research   Proposal   (Replication   Plan)1.   Introduce   the   topic.   Briefly   state   the   context   of   your   research.   State   the   research   problem   and discuss the motivation for this research (e.g., what is the area of conflict, concern, or controversy; something that needs solution?).Ø   Clearly   state   the   research   question    hypothesis.✓   Clearly   state   the   research question   (s)   that   you would   like   to   investigate.   Briefly discuss   the rationale, supporting your claim using evidence from the literature.✓   What is the research hypothesis (e.g., I will test the hypothesis that income inequality has increased in Australia over the last two decades).Ø   What   is   the   expected   contribution   of   this   research?2.   Briefly   discuss   the   proposed   empirical   approach   with   respect   to   the   following:i.   Data:   at   the   least   mention   the following:a.   the   name of   the survey, study period, type of   data (cross sectional, time series,   pooled or panel, survey design if relevant (e.g., stratified random sample).b.   Your   expected   sample   size.c.   Unit   of   analysis   (e.g.,   women   aged   14-49   years   or   households/families   with children or cities with population < X million).ii.   Key   variables:   e.g.,   key dependent   variable,   key   independent   variable,   control   variables.iii.   Proposed empirical strategy (e.g., Logistic regression, Panel fixed effect, ARDL etc.). Include   a   brief   justification   as   to   why   this   is   the   appropriate   method   to   test   your   hypothesis.Section   2:   Literature   reviewYou   will   review   of   the   scholarly   literature   using   relevant   database   (Google   scholar,   Econlit, OP’s   reference   list).   In   your   literature   review,   you   are required   to   include   some   output   generated by ChatGPT and highlight them.   Subsequently we will evaluate the co-creation with   AI代 写ECON7030 FULL CITATION OF YOUR REPLICATION PAPER/REPORT CHAPTER

We will assess you on the following aspects:·   Prompt:   How   effectively   you   design   the   prompt(s)   for   AI, appropriately   incorporating disciplinary knowledge.·   Critical evaluation: How well you evaluate and utilize AI-suggested resources, as in whether   you   simply   adopt   AI-generated   content   or   make   conscious   choices   about   what to include.·   Information and digital literacy: How you complement AI-generated content by relevant scholarly sources based on your own literature search, to enhance the reliability of the output.·   Ethical consideration: Your awareness of the reliability, biases, and other limitations of AI-generated content.
The   literature   review   MUST   focus   on   the   following:1.   Core issues. In general, how has thinking in this area of research evolved over time and how has this informed the analytical approach of the selected study. Also review the key issues related to data and study design.2.   Conceptual framework. What theoretical framework/conceptual framework guides the research design / and analytical approach in this literature?3.   Identify the gap in the literature: In what way(s) is the current state of knowledge on your selected topic is lacking/limited / in need of extending? Include a brief discussion on what is missing   in   this   literature.   4.   Conclusion. Conclude by highlighting future direction(s) of research – what remains to be done in this literature.5.   Evaluating   co-creation   with   AI. The   final paragraph   of your   literature   review   must include   a brief evaluation of your interaction with ChatGPT versus your own search of the literature. You are required to comment on the following:ü   Clearly state your prompt.ü   Do   you   think   you   could   solely   rely   on   AI-generated output to write the literature review? Why or why not?ü   How   do   the   scholarly   citations   that   you   have included through your own search improve   upon   ChatGPT   generated output?
